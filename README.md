It is a game about falling ball.

Your job is to make sure that ball wont be crushed by platforms that are raising to the celling.
You can do this by falling into platforms' holes.

For example you can make your ball smaller or holes in platforms bigger.
There are also power ups and power downs in the game which will make game easier or harder for certain amount of the time.
